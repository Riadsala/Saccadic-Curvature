Saccades were parsed using the Eyelink and Nystrom filters. The data was cleaned by stepping through the following steps:

\begin{itemize}
\item The initial fixation from every scan-path was removed (1058 saccades).
\item Saccades containing samples that fell outside image boundary  (256 saccades).
\item Preceding fixation with duration greater than 2000ms (1480 saccades).
\item Preceding fixation with duration less than 50ms (69 saccades)\footnote{Remember to check why a small number of fixations have 0ms duration???}.
\item Saccades with fewer than 10 samples (0 saccades).
\end{itemize}

This left us with a total of 14,400 saccades with
